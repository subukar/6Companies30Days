Question: Print Anagrams Together
Given an array of strings, return all groups of strings that are anagrams. The groups must be created in order of their appearance in the original array. 

Expected Time Complexity: O(N*|S|*log|S|), where |S| is the length of the strings.
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(N*|S|), where |S| is the length of the strings.

Code (C++):


class Solution{
  public:
    vector<vector<string> > Anagrams(vector<string>& string_list) {
        //code here
        vector<vector<string>> ans;
        unordered_map<string, vector<string>> mp;
        for(int i=0;i<string_list.size();i++){
            string word= string_list[i]; // To convert the word into its lexicographically sorted form.
            sort(word.begin(), word.end());  
            mp[word].push_back(string_list[i]); // The map will contain vectors of anagrams with key as the lexicographically sorted form of that vector.
        }
        for(auto it:mp){
            ans.push_back(it.second); // ans will store the group of strings which are anagrams as 1 vector for each group.
        }
        return ans;
    }
};
